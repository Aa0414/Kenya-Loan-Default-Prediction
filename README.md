# Kenya-Loan-Default-Prediction
This project focuses on building a machine-learning model to predict whether a borrower will default on a credit-card loan. Using the Zindi credit-risk dataset, we explored the data, engineered features, and trained multiple classification models to understand which approaches performed best.
